"Hello Replit AI Agent!

I have imported a GitHub repository for a 'CitizenFeedback civic platform' designed for citizens of Uzbekistan. The project is currently unfinished, with many issues.

My goal is for you to make this a fully functional, production-ready, full-stack working platform. Please identify and fix ALL issues across the entire codebase. Here is a comprehensive list of areas to focus on:

**Primary Objective:** Transform this into a robust and secure full-stack civic feedback platform for Uzbekistan.

**Specific Areas to Debug and Enhance:**

**1. Core Functionality & Logic Errors:**
* **Submission Process:** Ensure that feedback/reports can be submitted successfully.
* **Data Persistence:** Verify that submitted data is correctly stored in the database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc. - *specify your database if known*).
* **Retrieval:** Ensure all submitted feedback can be retrieved and displayed correctly.
* **Categorization/Tagging:** If there are categories or tags for feedback, ensure they are applied and filterable.
* **User Accounts (if applicable):**
    * Registration, Login, Logout: Full functionality.
    * Password hashing and security.
    * User profiles and settings.
* **Admin Panel (if applicable):**
    * Ability for administrators to view, filter, moderate, and manage feedback.
    * User management (if roles exist).
* **Notifications:** If notification systems are intended (e.g., email, in-app), ensure they trigger correctly.
* **Reporting/Analytics:** If any basic reporting or analytics are present, verify their accuracy.

**2. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) Problems:**
* **Broken Buttons/Links:** Identify and fix any non-functional buttons, links, or navigation elements.
* **Layout Issues:** Address any misaligned elements, broken responsiveness (for different screen sizes), or aesthetic inconsistencies.
* **Navigation:** Ensure intuitive and clear navigation throughout the platform.
* **Form Validation:** Implement robust client-side and server-side validation for all forms (e.g., preventing empty submissions, incorrect data formats).
* **Feedback/Error Messages:** Provide clear and helpful feedback to users (e.g., success messages after submission, informative error messages for failures).
* **Accessibility:** Consider basic accessibility principles (e.g., keyboard navigation, proper alt text for images).
* **Uzbekistan Context:**
    * **Language Support:** Ensure proper localization for Uzbek and Russian languages if intended. If not, explicitly state that English is the primary language, but consider basic Uzbek/Russian UI elements for familiarity.
    * **Cultural Nuances:** Advise on any UX improvements that would resonate better with the local user base in Uzbekistan (e.g., common communication styles, privacy expectations).

**3. Security Vulnerabilities:**
* **Input Sanitization:** Prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks by sanitizing all user inputs.
* **Authentication & Authorization:**
    * Secure session management.
    * Proper role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access what they're permitted to.
    * Protection against brute-force attacks.
* **API Security:** If REST APIs are used, ensure proper authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
* **Data Encryption:** Secure sensitive data both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption if applicable).
* **Dependency Security:** Check for and update any outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries/packages.
* **Environment Variables:** Ensure sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) are stored securely as environment variables, not hardcoded.

**4. Performance Issues:**
* **Loading Times:** Optimize asset loading (images, CSS, JS), and ensure quick page load times.
* **Database Queries:** Identify and optimize inefficient database queries.
* **Server Response Time:** Look for bottlenecks in backend logic that cause slow responses.
* **Scalability:** Provide recommendations or implement basic patterns for future scalability (e.g., efficient data handling, caching strategies).

**5. Code Quality & Maintainability:**
* **Code Structure:** Organize the codebase into logical modules/components.
* **Readability:** Ensure code is clean, well-commented, and follows consistent coding standards.
* **Redundancy:** Remove any duplicate or unnecessary code.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms across the stack.
* **Modularity:** Break down large functions/files into smaller, reusable components.

**6. Deployment & Configuration:**
* **Environment Setup:** Ensure the project can be easily set up and run within the Replit environment.
* **Dependency Management:** Verify all dependencies are correctly listed and installed.
* **Build Process:** If there's a build step (e.g., for frontend frameworks), ensure it's functional.
* **Database Connection:** Confirm database connection strings and configurations are correct and secure.

**Instructions for the AI Agent's Process:**

1.  **Analyze the existing codebase:** Start by thoroughly reviewing the current state of the project.
2.  **Identify and list all issues:** Provide a detailed list of every bug, error, security flaw, and UX problem you find.
3.  **Propose solutions:** For each identified issue, suggest a concrete plan for how to fix it.
4.  **Implement fixes iteratively:** Apply the proposed fixes, testing each change to ensure it doesn't introduce new problems.
5.  **Refactor and optimize:** Improve code quality, performance, and maintainability.
6.  **Provide a summary of changes:** At the end, give a clear report of all the changes you've made and why.
7.  **Suggest next steps:** Outline any further recommendations for enhancing the platform (e.g., new features, more advanced security).

I understand this is a complex task. Please take your time and be thorough. I will be reviewing your progress and output."
